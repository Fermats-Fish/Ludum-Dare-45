# Ludum-Dare-45

This is the source code for a game I made for Ludum Dare 45 in under 48 hours. The game can be played here: https://fermatsfish.itch.io/stay-alive-2-survive.

Since it was made in under 48 hours it has less commenting than usual, and the coding will not be of my usual standard.

Note that this game was made using Unity 5.6.0f3, and that to compile this code you will need to copy these files into a new Unity project folder.
